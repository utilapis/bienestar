Yerba Mate Gourd Tea is a drink that is traditionally consumed in many South American countries.  Brewed from the dried leaves of the yerba mate, the drink has multiple health benefits. It is an energy booster a mood stabilizer and the tea also has antioxidant properties.
Drinking yerba mate traditionally involves mixing hot water with ground-up dried leaves of the yerba mate in a hollowed-out gourd. The Bienestar vacuum insulated mate cup simulates the shape of a gourd, giving you an authentic mate drinking experience. However, unlike a gourd, the stainless steel cup by Bienestar is much more long-lasting and easier to clean, being dishwasher safe. The insulated aluminum walls keep the yerba mate, or any other drink for that matter, warm for longer and preserving the flavor. You can even use the cup for drinking any other kind of tea (like matcha) or coffee or even for eating ice cream. The stainless steel on the mate cup is 18.8 and is food grade while the double walls are made up of aluminum to maximize insulation so drinks can be kept hot or cold for longer periods.
The Bienestar mate cup combines the unique tradition of drinking yerba mate from a specially shaped cup with the convenience of easy maintenance and a durable design.
